## Project Overview
The Balance of Payments (BoP) is a financial statement that summarizes a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world over a specific period. It consists of three main components:
- **Current Account:** Tracks trade in goods and services, income from investments, and remittances.
- **Capital Account:** Records transfers of financial assets, such as investments or grants, between countries.
- **Financial Account:** Captures changes in ownership of international assets, including foreign investments and reserves.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Balance of Payments and the economic performance of five European countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany. Using these components, the project highlights key trends such as trade balances, capital inflows, and investment dynamics, offering valuable insights into these nations' economic activities.

## Key Insights
### Albania
![Albania](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbdd390c-5f28-4906-956e-fa16b9ca5402)
- There was a surplus in Albania's Capital Account with a sharp increase in 2021. This was due to the capital account credits exceeding the capital account debits. This indicates that more capital flows into the country than goes out. 
- Albania experienced a Current Account Deficit. The deficit results from a negative balance on goods and services, as the imports exceed exports significantly. While primary income (like earnings on investments) and secondary income (such as remittances) are positive, they are insufficient to offset the trade deficit.
- Financial Account Deficit: This deficit is driven by negative contributions from direct investment and other investments, with consistent downward trends. These components suggest that more money is leaving Albania through investments than coming in, leading to a net outflow of financial resources.
