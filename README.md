## Project Overview
The Balance of Payments (BoP) is a financial statement that summarizes a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world over a specific period. It consists of three main components:
- **Current Account:** Tracks trade in goods and services, income from investments, and remittances.
- **Capital Account:** Records transfers of financial assets, such as investments or grants, between countries.
- **Financial Account:** Captures changes in ownership of international assets, including foreign investments and reserves.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Balance of Payments and the economic performance of five European countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany. Using these components, the project highlights key trends such as trade balances, capital inflows, and investment dynamics, offering valuable insights into these nations' economic activities.
